# scrape-jobs
Scraper built using BeautifulSoup.
This script will allow you to scrape jobs based on a search parameter from Hipo.ro from a set number of pages (predefined 5 but can be changed).
At the moment it returns the company name, job name, company address, job type, required experience, post date, page number and a link to the ad.
